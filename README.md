This is the code used to select the input/output pairs for the GEM 2024 shared task. It was adapted from the WebNLG'23 code. Thanks to Liam Cripwell, Rudali Huidrom and Michela Lorandi for making their versions of the code available.

After running the first 3 cells, drag and drop an input file in the xml format in the *testdata* folder, then run the rest of the cells after selecting the parameters from the dropdown menu when needed.
